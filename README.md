# Muted Green Base Map

I wanted to design a base map that reflected the green of the Pacific Northwest. I tend to like muted colors that might allow other data to stand out, so I chose some more muted greens and blues for the landscape and brown for the labels. I didn't want the labels to stand out too much but did want them to be legible; I kept the halo around the text but matched it more to the background color.
